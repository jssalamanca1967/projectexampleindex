            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Life expectancy and GDP vary significantly across continents. North America and Europe typically enjoy
                higher GDP and longer life expectancies due to better healthcare and living standards.
                In contrast, many African countries face lower GDP and shorter life expectancies due to health
                challenges.
                Asia presents a mixed picture, with high life expectancy and GDP in countries like Japan and South
                Korea, while others in South and Southeast Asia have lower figures.
                Overall, higher GDP is strongly correlated with increased life expectancy, underscoring the influence of
                economic development on health outcomes.

                Nigeria, and India.
                The United States had the highest per capita income, followed closely by the United Kingdom.
                China’s GDP per capita was lower but marked by impressive growth. India’s income was moderate, while
                Nigeria and the Congo had among the lowest GDP per capita, reflecting ongoing economic and developmental

                occasional dips like during the 2008 crisis.
                China saw rapid growth due to economic reforms, significantly boosting its per capita income.
                India experienced solid growth from liberalization, though more gradual than China.
                The Congo, however, faced slow growth due to political and economic challenges, keeping its GDP per
                capita
                among the lowest

                In contrast, Pakistan faces major challenges, ranking low due to cultural and social barriers that limit
                women's access to education and work.
                While the Philippines shows notable gender equality, Pakistan continues to struggle with deep-rooted
                societal constraints.

            <h2>Section 5: Inflation since 1800</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Since 1800, worldwide inflation has fluctuated due to significant economic, political, and technological
                changes.
                The 19th century generally experienced low and stable inflation, except during major events like wars
                and
                gold discoveries.
                The 20th century brought more volatility, with hyperinflation episodes following World War I and II in
                several countries and the oil crises of the 1970s triggering global inflation surges.
                Economic stabilization efforts in the late 20th century led to more controlled inflation rates in
                developed
                economies.
                The 21st century has seen periods of both low inflation and deflation, until the COVID-19 pandemic and
                subsequent supply chain disruptions, alongside geopolitical tensions, drove a resurgence of inflation
                globally by the early 2020s.

                From 1980 to 2022, GDP in constant prices showed distinct patterns across the Congo, United Kingdom,
                Kenya,
                and Japan.
                The UK and Japan, as advanced economies, experienced strong growth until setbacks like Japan's 1990s
                stagnation and the 2008 financial crisis.
                Kenya's GDP grew steadily due to expanding sectors, while the Congo faced volatility from political and
                economic challenges.
                By 2022, the UK and Japan maintained higher GDPs, with Kenya showing consistent growth and the Congo

                Between 2000 and 2022, Germany's unemployment rate fluctuated significantly. It peaked around 11% in
                2005 due to economic challenges but steadily declined. By 2019, it reached a low of about 3.2% due to
                economic growth.
                The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 briefly increased unemployment, but government support helped stabilize

                Real weekly wages in the UK from 2000 to 2024 have fluctuated significantly due to economic conditions
                and inflation.
                After steady growth in the early 2000s, wages stagnated following the 2008 financial crisis and

                The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted wage growth, although government support measures helped
                stabilize incomes.
                By 2024, while real weekly wages are anticipated to have improved, rising living costs and inflation
                continue to challenge workers' purchasing power.

            <h2> Trading nation: How can we get Britain exporting again? </h2>
            <p>
                Does the UK's future economic growth rely on exports? And if it does, what can we export to boost the
                country’s economy?
                The panel explores the strategies and policies needed to help boost the British export market, which is
                increasingly service-based.
                
            <p>
            <h2>Section 9: Real Exports in UK </h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Real exports in the UK from 1990 to 2024 have shown significant variability, influenced by economic
                trends, global market conditions, and trade policies.
                In the 1990s, exports experienced steady growth, bolstered by the expansion of the European Union and
                globalization.
                However, the 2008 financial crisis led to a sharp decline in exports, followed by a slow recovery in the
                2010s.
                The UK's decision to leave the EU in 2016 introduced new trade dynamics, initially creating uncertainty
                that affected export performance. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, exports faced further challenges
                but have gradually rebounded.
                By 2024, real exports are expected to have improved as the UK adapts to post-Brexit trade relationships
                and seeks new markets.

            <h2>Section 10: Real Imports in UK</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                From 1990 to 2024, UK real imports experienced growth and fluctuations influenced by economic shifts.
                Imports rose in the 1990s and early 2000s due to economic expansion and EU integration.
                The 2008 financial crisis caused a temporary drop, followed by recovery.
                Brexit in 2016 brought trade uncertainties, affecting imports, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 disrupted supply chains. 
                By 2024, imports are expected to have rebounded as the UK adjusts to new trade conditions post-Brexit and post-pandemic.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            To boost Britain’s export growth and strengthen its global position, policies should focus on forging new trade agreements, reducing barriers, and diversifying export markets. 
            Investing in innovation and aligning regulatory standards with key partners can enhance competitiveness. 
            Supporting infrastructure and resilient supply chains will further optimize trade, reinforcing the UK’s economic standing.
